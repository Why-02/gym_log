  "Idea": '''
  - A training principle where the stress place on the body is gradually increased over time
  - It prevents the body from fully adapting to your current workout routing
  - It helps avoid plateaus in muscle growth and strength gains
  ''',

  "Simple Form": '''
  The simplest form of progressive overload is to increase the weight of exercises by 2.5 kg each week.
  This is easy to implement since most gym machines allow the addition of up to two small plates of 2.5 kg.

  If you're unable to increase the weight by 2.5 kg, consider adding 1 or 2 extra reps instead.
  The following week, return to your original rep count and attempt to increase the weight again as planned.
  ''',

  "Volume-Based Form": '''
  This form is a more general one where you increase the volume of training over time. 

  Volume = Sets * Reps * Weight

  This means to increase the volume, you do not have to increase the weight. You can:
  - increase the number of sets between a week and the next one (ex: from 3 to 4)
  - increase the number of reps between a week and the next one (ex: from 8 to 10)
  - increase the weight between a week and the next one (ex: from 40kg to 42.5kg)

  This method works well for hypertrophy and managing fatigue while still promoting overload.
